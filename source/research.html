          <h2>Abstract</h2>
          <p>In this paper, we present methods for segmenting noisy two-dimensional forward-scan sonar images and classify and model their background. The segmentation approach differentiates the highlight blobs, cast shadows, and the background of sonar images. There is usually little information within relatively large background regions corresponding to the flat sea bottom and (or) water column, as they are often corrupted with speckle noise. Our experiments show that the background texture is dominated by the speckle noise which has the appearance of a pseudo-random texture. We show that the background texture of the underwater sonar images can be categorized by a small number of classes. The statistical features work better than the texture-based features in categorizing the pseudo-random background, which further strengthen our hypothesis of the dominance of noise over the background texture. As a result, we can model the noisy background with a few parameters. This has an application in coding the sonar images in which highlight blob regions and cast shadows are coded at the encoder side while the speckle noise-corrupted background can be synthesized at the decoder side. Since the background regions occupy a large fraction of the FS sonar image, we expect higher compression rates than most current image or video coding standards and other custom-designed sonar image compression techniques.</p>

          <h2>Introduction</h2>
          <article>
            <p>Acoustic signals can penetrate through silt and other sources of turbidity that prohibit the deployment of optical systems, the most common imaging modality in the terrestrial domain. This has motivated the development and improvement of highfrequency 2-D forward-scan (FS) video sonar systems over the past decade, to meet the critical need of scene imaging at improved resolution under poor visibility [1]. Automated processing of FS sonar video imagery enables significant capabilities for a wide variety of underwater task and operations, e.g., fish stock assessment, seafloor and habitat mapping, and the inspection of pipelines and other structures.</p>

            <p>Automated sonar image processing is rather complex due to presence of and interactions among visual cues and artifacts. To elaborate, we first note that FS sonar systems are typically deployed at large grazing angles (relative to the sea bottom) in order to 1) image a larger region of the sea floor within a single image; 2) improve image quality and contrast by increasing the diffuse backscatter returns relative to specular reflections. Consequently, referring to the cartoon drawing in Fig. 1(a), the 3-D targets on the sea bottom can often be detected by two visual cues with distinct characteristics: 1) A thin but horizontally elongated bright image blob, generated by the backscattered signal from visible object surfaces; 2) shadows cast by the object on neighboring background surfaces. In addition to target detection, the cast shadows provide useful visual cues for 3-D object shape reconstruction and sonar motion estimation [1], [2]. Additionally, artifacts within these regions can arise due to multiple reflections.</p>
