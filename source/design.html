          <h2>Abstract</h2>
          <p>We are going to design a voice-controlled car. It will be demonstrated on a toy car. Basically, the setup is a voice recognition module mounted on an Arduino board and an additional Arduino board together as a complete system on the toy car. The VR Arduino board should be able to recognize voice commands on a real time basis. Then we can control the toy car by just saying “go left”, “go right”, “back” and “forward”. (The estimated operating range is the radius of 5m). Also, the system could recognize at least two languages (English and Chinese).</p>

          <h2>Introduction</h2>
          <article>
            <div id="vc-left">
            <h3>I. Problem Statement</h3>
            <p>Traditionally, a driver needs to operate the vehicle using steering wheels and transmission controller. However, some circumstances do not allow the driver to have the ability to drive, for example: the steering wheel is locked in place or brake pedal irresponsive due to mechanical malfunction (while the brake system itself is operational). A voice controlled vehicle is a viable solution to this problem. On other occasions like parking a car, the driver needs to be inside the vehicle, but with a voice controlled module, it can be done outside of car with the driver possessing improved perspective for parking.</p>

            <h3>II. General Information</h3>
            <p>Google launched self-driving car project a few years ago and progress has been made over the years. Their project majorly focus on machine decision making based on map data. Thus it focuses on data-driven decision making and machine learning. While our concept majorly focuses on developing a system that recognizes voice and make adjustments accordingly on a real time basis. While the self-driving car only needs one input: the destination, a voice controlled car needs frequent (if not incessant) voice input. However, in voice command car human makes the decision, some of which are totally deprived in self- driving cars like the travel route and response under emergency situations.</p>

            <p>Additionally, the sensors on self-driving cars lack the precision of a human eye, especially during heavy weather. Other numerous limitations like small debris, trash and obstacles have proved to be a problem for self- driving car’s software, processing a large chunk of information and steering the car in the same time has also proved to be a major challenge.</p>

            <p>Our project aims to combine voice recognition and car operation in order to reduce the effort to operate a car, while the on- road operations still requiring the “driver” to be constantly watching the traffic. The major challenge for our project is voice recognition: it needs to be precise enough with minimal error rate. The voice module should have a characterization file linked to make data driven decisions: if possible the file should feature the voice of a specific person, thus optimized for that person and keep mistakes at minimum.</p>
            </div>

            <div id="vc-right">
            <p>Since safety is the top priority for vehicles controlled purely by voice, the voice recognition should be modified to accustom the driver only, who has the complete control over the system, while the driver moving his control to another person should be an optional feature of the system.</p>

            <p>Voice recognition has been a popular field especially in smartphone and mobile devices, yet very few people are working on voiced recognitions on cars. This because the voice recognition tends to fail to recognize command or make mistakes, but in order to operate a motor vehicle without any risk of accident, there would be no room for mistakes.</p>

            <p>However, this should not be the reason not implementing voice recognition on cars at all, in another word, the voice recognition system can serve as a backup option to control the car during emergency or a useful parking utility if it is not intended to be the major method of operating a car, this is all due to the innate advantage of voice recognition and its versatility. Since legalization for voice recognizing cars will be a long and painful process to eventually enter the market, regarding the numerous safety concerns involved. However, controlling a car using one’s voice on other occasions like parking a car or using as an emergency control would be relatively easy to pass legislation obstacles, because parking only involves low speed motion of the vehicle and emergency should only be engaged while the normal operating system is irresponsive as a last ditch effort to regain the control of the vehicle. Thus the voice control system can still be a valuable enough addition to the existing motor system.</p>

            <p>The only difficulty for this project to materialize on the market is the nature of the automobiles nowadays: the motors are way more complicated than electric servos which only will have its performance regulated by the voltage. In order to implement a smooth voice control system on a car for the manufacturer it requires a mass amount of real world data of the specific model of the vehicle which it wants to implement the voice recognition feature, and a long development time to design an efficient control system, which should certainly include features like automatic corrections from the motor feedback.</p>

            <h3>I. Design Decisions</h3>
            <p class="impdec"><strong>Important decision 1: implementing the system on a toy car</strong></p>
            <p>Due to the limitation of the budget and limited real car knowledge of our group members, working on a real car would be prohibitive. Plus, as mentioned in the previous section, implementing the system on a real car is obviously a project in much grander scale: therefore, a toy car should be used to demonstrate the voice control system. The car should react to simple real time commands with precision. It should also have the minimum extent of safety measurements with the help of ultrasonic ranging devices installed outside of the car. The car should recognize as many commands as possible with given hardware limit. Although it’s a toy car, many factors (like those mentioned above) in real life affecting the viability of the project should be thoroughly considered.</p>

            <div id="dd-right">
            <p class="impdec"><strong>Important decision 2: using 2 Arduino chips instead of one</strong></p>
            <p>We divide the functionality of the system into two Arduino chips: the first chip (main chip) controls the motors using the voice recognition module which requires a constant ongoing loop in the programming, the ultrasonic range finding device, on the other hand, requires constant pulse input and will feed signals back from its echo output on a regular basis, which requires a loop to perform calculation and handle the interrupt as well. Thus a second chip (monitoring chip) is needed. However, we also have the alternative method of using one Arduino to handle both ultrasonic interruption and voice recognition in the same time; it is totally achievable via manipulating the built in timer inside the Arduino chip (special thanks to Dr. John for advice), there will be additional pages explaining how to implement this and the reason for us to use two Arduinos instead of just one in the Appendix.</p>
